Suicide rates, anxiety rates, and depression rates in youth have been steadily growing over the past decade, and a large part of this can be attributed to the competition created for teenagers still developing their emotional maturity.</p><p>The education system should help children in not only their academic development but also their mental and emotional growth. Schools should prepare kids for being productive members of society, which means not only academic attainment but also providing an environment in which children can mature emotionally.</p><p>As a student in a prestigious international school, I have seen time and time again attachment to grades crippling countless talented, potent children. What happens to these bright kids is that because of praise lauded onto them by adults, they begin to attach themselves to their grades emotionally as a source of personal pride. This attachment is incredibly unhealthy for the bulk of maturing teenagers. One symptom of this problem is that inevitably, when their grades drop, their pride is chipped away at, something devastatingly so.</p><p>Grades once served a purpose, being quick and easy ways to describe academic performance. Although grades aren’t new, our fixation on them is. In today’s cutthroat environment, they are harmful to the mental health of our future workforce. Because of the sheer number of students today, schools are forced to quickly assess their ability, and it is this combination of intense competition and overvaluation of grades that is permanently damaging to our children’s mental health.</p><p>Whenever I talk about the problems in our current education system, I get almost universal agreement from teachers, students, parents and citizens. Despite this, there’s a general lack of action taken against these societal problems.</p><p>We need to look hard at our education system and see what’s working and what’s not- shifting focus from letter grades to individual, case-by-case student improvement is an important first step.</p><p>The problems of tomorrow’s Malaysia are created in the classrooms of today.</p></article></main><hr><footer class="footer" role="contentinfo"> <small> © 2020 | <a href="http://instagram.com/isaac.fj.lim">Insta</a> | <a href="mailto:ilim10@yahoo.com">Email</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-lim-6b89331aa/">Linkedin</a> </small></footer></body></html>
