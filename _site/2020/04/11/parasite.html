The film depicts the poor Kim family infiltrating the richer Park family, and has resonated with audiences around the world largely because of its ability to immerse audience members in this fictional world.</p><p>According to several interviews with the production designer for this piece, Bong had from the very start a clear vision of the architecture of both houses featured in the film, and was highly involved with the design of these houses, through 3D modelling. When Kevin, the son of the Kim family, first enters the Park house, he moves up multiple flights of stairs, while his own home is a semi-basement, deep in the ground- the space itself is a metaphor for status.</p><p>Watching the film, you might not notice any CGI - but there are computer generated elements everywhere. The top half of the Park house, the Kim’s street, shots in the rain were all computer-generated. This new trend, known as <strong>invisible effects</strong> is ****where VFX is used to extend sets, build crowds, improve background, and swap out clothing. This allows for more flexibility to stick to the director’s vision in post-production, after the film is shot.</p><p>A tried and true cornerstone of writing advice is writing what you know. Parasite is a shining example of this. Bong worked as a tutor for a wealthy family in Seoul, and used this experience as a starting point for his writing of Parasite. Bong fleshes out the lore of his world through little details such as pizza box folding records, Taiwanese castella stores, and jjapguri, a type of ramen, topped with steak, which may not seem like much, but combined, make the world feel so much more believable.</p><p>What this means for writers, actors, filmmakers, or any young creative storytellers is that immersing your audience in your world is incredibly important to make it feel real, and this can be done through setting, technology, details and drawing from your own past experiences.</p></article></main><hr><footer class="footer" role="contentinfo"> <small> © 2020 | <a href="http://instagram.com/isaac.fj.lim">Insta</a> | <a href="mailto:ilim10@yahoo.com">Email</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-lim-6b89331aa/">Linkedin</a> </small></footer></body></html>
