            <p>I just wanted to get rid of that ugly sight that was my ugly site before this makeover. So now I thought about my personal branding, gave the site a makeover, and now it probably looks good. I hope. This site will be the place where I dump all my dumb thoughts and ideas. <br>I promise more stuff will be here soon.</p>
